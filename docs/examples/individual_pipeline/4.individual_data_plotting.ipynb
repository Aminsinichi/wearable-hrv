    "In this individual pipeline, there are also many plotting options. Of course, plotting the results for one individual subject for all the conditions and devices may not necessarily be very informative about the performance and validity of a device, but it can still be very interesting to see. It can also come in handy if a researcher is not planning to run a full validation study but would like to only test a device against a criterion in a couple of conditions, and get a sense of how well it performs."

    "When looking at the line plot, and if you are especially interested in seeing the trends and changes from one condition to another, the following function, `display_changes`, can come in handy. It will first display a table containing the calculated values based on your selection with the widgets for the time-domain and frequency domain, in all devices and conditions. Moreover, it also shows the table of \"changes\"â€”how those values changed from the previous condition to the next. Why can this be interesting? Because then you can numerically see some systematic biases. For instance, if the criterion device is changing -84.08 RMSSD values from the \"neurotask\" condition to the \"walking\" condition, and a device, e.g., Kyto, shows a positive 69.77 (!), that shows how it is overestimating the RMSSD values. In short, you can check the \"direction\" and the \"magnitude\" of changes from one condition to the next and get a sense of biases."
