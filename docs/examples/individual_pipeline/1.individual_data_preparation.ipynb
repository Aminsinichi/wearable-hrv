    "# Preparing Your Data for wearablehrv \n",
    "This example shows you how to prepare and name your files, such that it is readble for `wearablehrv`. It also involves importing all your recorded datasets in one go, as well as defining and importing experimental events. We will provide some sample data and a detailed explanation of this data to help you get started with the package and give you an idea of how you could conduct a similar validation study.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The notebook examples located in the \"individual\" folder utilize the `individual` module from `wearablehrv`. These examples are designed to handle data from <u>a single participant</u>, who may have worn multiple wearables simultaneously. As long as the detected interbeat intervals and timestamps are stored, `wearablehrv` facilitates the journey from raw data to group statistical analysis. It offers a range of plotting functionalities to assist in decision-making or data pre-processing, along with user-friendly graphical user interfaces.\n",
