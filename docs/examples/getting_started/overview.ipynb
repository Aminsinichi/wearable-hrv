    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`wearablehrv` is a Python package that comes in handy if you want to validate wearables and establish their accuracy in terms of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). `wearablehrv` is a complete and comprehensive pipeline that helps you go from your recorded raw data through all the necessary pre-processing steps, data analysis, and many visualization tools with graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package is divided into two broad ranges of functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Pipeline**: You use it for a single participant to process your raw data.\n",
    "- **Group Pipeline**: You use it when you have multiple participants, and you have processed them through the Individual Pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we offer a quick overview of the main functionalities."

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "When one wants to establish the validity of a wearable, let's say a smartwatch, that records heart rate and heart rate variability, they should use a \"ground truth\" device. This is usually a gold-standard electrocardiography (ECG) that measures HR and HRV accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We call this gold-standard a \"criterion\" device in our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a participant wears this ECG, together with the smartwatch, and starts recording data simultaneously. It is beneficial if we test the subject in various conditions, so we get a better sense of how well the device works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, validating multiple devices at once is a cumbersome task, requiring a lot of data preparation, processing, different alignments, etc. **A powerful feature in `wearablehrv` is that it does not matter how many devices in how many conditions you want to test a participant!** You just record your data, and the pipeline walks you through this data to the final decision on whether a device is accurate compared to the ground truth or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how your experiment may look like: a participant wearing a few wearables named Kyto, Heartmath, Empatica, Rhythm, together with a gold-standard ECG (VU-AMS), with electrodes on the chest, and will perform different tasks in different conditions (e.g., sitting for 5 minutes, standing up for 3 minutes, walking for 3 minutes, and biking for 3 minutes, while having all the devices on):\n",
